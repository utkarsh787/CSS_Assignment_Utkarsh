Question1-What is the use of float property? Which property is the better alternative to it?

Answer1-The float property in CSS was traditionally used to wrap text around images or create 
multi-column layouts. However, it has several limitations and can be tricky to work with:

Issues with float:
Complex clearing problems: It often requires hacks like "clearfix" to prevent layout issues.
Difficult to maintain: Layouts using float can be hard to control and inconsistent.
Unexpected behavior: Elements might not behave as expected, particularly with heights and parent-child relationships.
Better modern alternatives:

1.Flexbox
Ideal for one-dimensional layouts (either rows or columns).
Simplifies vertical centering and space distribution.
Provides better control over element ordering.

Ex:
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-itmes:center;
}

2.CSS Grid

Perfect for two-dimensional layouts (both rows and columns together).
Designed specifically for page layouts.
Offers intuitive alignment controls and is better suited for responsive design.
Ex:

.container{
    display:grid;
}
