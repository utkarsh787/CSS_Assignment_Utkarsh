Question3-What are the different types of CSS Selectors?

Answer3-The different types of CSS selectors are as follows:

1. Element Selectors:
   - Selects elements based on their tag name.
   - Example:
     p {
         color: red;    /* Selects all <p> elements */
     }

2. Class Selectors:
   - Selects elements that have a specific class.
   - Example:
     .nav {
         display: flex; /* Selects all elements with class="nav" */
     }

3. Id Selectors:
   - Selects a specific element with a unique id.
   - Example:
     #inp {
         display: inline-block;  /* Selects an element with id="inp" */
     }

4. Pseudo-Classes:
   - Selects elements based on their state or interaction (e.g., hover).
   - Example:
     a:hover {
         text-decoration: underline; /* Selects <a> tag in its hover state */
     }

5. Pseudo-Elements:
   - Selects and applies styles to specific parts of an element, such as the first letter or line.
   - Example:
     p::first-line {
         font-variant: small-caps;  /* Applies text style to the first line of <p> */
     }

6. Descendant Selectors:
   - Selects elements that are nested inside a specific parent element.
   - Example:
     div p {
         margin: 10px;  /* Selects all <p> elements inside <div> */
     }

7. Attribute Selectors:
   - Selects elements based on a specific attribute and its value.
   - Example:
     input[type="text"] {
         border: 1px solid gray; /* Selects all <input> elements with type="text" */
     }

8. Universal Selectors:
   - Selects all elements in the document.
   - Example:
     * {
         margin: 0;  /* Selects all elements and removes their margin */
     }
